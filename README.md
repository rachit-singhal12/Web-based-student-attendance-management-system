# Web-based-student-attendance-management-system
this project is developed using html, CSS, JavaScript and php.
here we include admin, student and teacher portal and provide different level of authorities to each type admin having higher authority than teacher and student.
here we create a welcome page which include the login session for all of them.
Firstly, you have to import our database files in the database “eattendance” on phpMyAdmin.
Then you open project/front_page/code.html this will be the root file of all files.
